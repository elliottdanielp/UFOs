# Overview 
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

# Results
With such a big list of UFO sightings a search filter was necessary. Not just 1 but 5 different filters have been added to narrow down your search for exactly what you are looking for.

In order to use the filter simply input the results you are searching for in the appropriate filter search box. For example if you are looking for all the sightings for 1/7/2010. Type 1/7/2010 in the "Enter Date" search box and press "ENTER" a list of all the sightings for that day will be returned.

# Summary

### <ins>Drawback of UFO Finder</ins>

One drawback for UFO Finder is that in order for viewers to use filter search they have to first scroll down to look at all the available dates, cities, states, countrys and shapes. 

### <ins>2 recommendations</ins> 

- A solution for this drawback is to replace the text input boxes with drop down-menus for available searches. For instances if a veiwer wanted to filter search by state they can click on state filter and a drop down menu will appear with all the available states in the data.

- There should also be "Clear Filters" button at the bottom of the "Filter Search" section so viewers can clear the search filters with a single click.
